These endpoints allow you to create, read, update and delete posts. Posts are the main content of a social network, can be created by any profile and can receive reactions and comments.

These endpoints support pagination and sorting. Read more about these features [here](../pagination-sorting).

    id: { type: "integer", description: "The unique identifier for the post." },

    _comments: { type: "boolean", default: "false", description: "Include comments." },
    _reactions: { type: "boolean", default: "false", description: "Include reactions." }
