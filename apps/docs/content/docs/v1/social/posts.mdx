<Callout variant="warning">
  These are authenticated endpoints. You can visit [authentication](./authentication) to get an access token.
</Callout>

These endpoints allow you to create, read, update and delete posts. Posts are the main content of a social network, can be created by any profile and can receive reactions and comments.

This is a paginated and sortable endpoint. You can use the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to paginate the results. You can also use the `sort` and `sortOrder` query parameters to sort the results. Read more about the pagination and sorting features [here](../pagination-sorting).

## The Post model

<TypeTable
  type={{
    id: { type: "integer", description: "The unique identifier for the post." },
    title: { type: "string", description: "The title of the post." },
    body: { type: "string", description: "The body of the post." },
    tags: { type: "Array<string>", description: "A string array of tags." },
    media: { type: "string", description: "A URL to an image or video." },
    created: { type: "string", description: "The date the post was created." },

    _count: {

      typeDescription: "{\n  comments: integer;\n  reactions: integer;\n}",
      description: "A JSON object containing the number of comments and reactions."
    }
  }}

    _comments: { type: "boolean", default: "false", description: "Include comments." },
    _reactions: { type: "boolean", default: "false", description: "Include reactions." }
