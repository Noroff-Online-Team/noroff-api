<Callout variant="info">This authentication is only related to the `/quotes` endpoints.</Callout>

Some endpoints may require you to be authenticated. This is done by sending an `Authorization` header with your access token along with your request.

<Hr />

## Login

<EndpointDetails method="POST" path="/auth/login" />

In order to receive an access token you will need to login. You do not need to
register an account, you can simply login with any username.

You can login by sending a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with your username in the request body.

```json title="Request"
{
  "username": "my_username"
}
```

In return you will receive a response with the following body:

```json title="Response"
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
}
```

You can now use this access token as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all endpoints that require authentication.

## Example of sending Authorization header.

The following example shows how to send an `Authorization` header with your request.

```js title="Example"
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/quotes`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```
