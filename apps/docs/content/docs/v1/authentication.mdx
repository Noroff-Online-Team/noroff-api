<Callout>
  The Noroff API has several authentication endpoints. Which one you should use depends on which endpoints you are
  trying to access.
</Callout>

The API will return a `401 Unauthorized` status if you do not provide a valid Authorization token. You can obtain a valid token by registering and logging in to the associated endpoint.

## Basic Endpoints

Some of these endpoints require authentication.

You should use the [Basic Endpoints Authentication](./basic-endpoints/authentication.md) if you are trying to access any of the Basic endpoints that require authentication.

## Social Endpoints

All of these endpoints require authentication.

You should use the [Social Authentication](./social-endpoints/authentication.md) if you are trying to access any of the Social endpoints.

## Auction House Endpoints

All of these endpoints require authentication.

You should use the [Auction House Authentication](./auctionhouse-endpoints/authentication.md) if you are trying to access any of the Auction House endpoints.
