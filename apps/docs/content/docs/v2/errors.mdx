## The error structure

<TypeTable
  type={{
    errors: {
      type: "Array<object>",
      typeDescription: "Array<{\n  code?: string;\n  message: string;\n  path?: Array<string>\n}>",
      description: "The errors"
    },
    "errors[].code?": {
      type: "string",
      description: "The error code. Typically related to validation errors."
    },
    "errors[].message": { type: "string", description: "The error message" },
    "errors[].path?": {
      type: "Array<string>",
      description: "The path of the property that caused the error. Typically related to validation errors."
    },
    status: { type: "string", description: "The HTTP status" },
    statusCode: { type: "number", description: "The HTTP status code" }
  }}

## Examples

Imagine you're trying to get a listing by its ID, but that listing doesn't exist. You will get the following error:

```json title="Example"
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "No listing with such ID"
    }
  ],
  "status": "Not Found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

In the above example, the `errors` property is an array of errors. In this case, there is only one error. The `status` property is the HTTP status, and the `statusCode` property is the HTTP status code number.

If the error is a validation error, we will return a more detailed error message. For example, if you try to delete an Auction House listing and the ID is not a valid listing ID (UUID), you will get the following error:

```json title="Validation Error Example"
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "invalid_string",
      "message": "ID must be a valid UUID",
      "path": ["id"]
    }
  ],
  "status": "Not Found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

In the above example, the `code` property is the error code, the `message` property is the error message, and the `path` property is the path to the property that caused the error. In this case, the `id` property caused the error.

As an example, you will receive the following error if you are not using the [new Media model](./dirrerences-from-v1#new-media-model) when adding images to the listing:

```json title="Validation Error Example"
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "invalid_type",
      "message": "Expected array, received string",
      "path": ["media"]
    }
  ],
  "status": "Bad Request",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```
