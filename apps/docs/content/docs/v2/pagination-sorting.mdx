## Pagination

Pagination can be used to limit the number of results returned by an API request. This is useful for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network, and for reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by the client.

You can use the `limit` and `page` query parameters to paginate through the results of an API request. The `limit` parameter specifies the number of results to return per page, and the `page` parameter indicates which page of results to retrieve. For example, to get the first 10 results, you would set `limit` to `10` and `page` to `1`. To access the next set of 10 results, simply switch `page` to `2`.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    limit: { type: "integer", default: "100", description: "The number of results to return." },
    page: { type: "integer", default: "1", description: "The page of results to return." }
  }}
/>

## Sorting

You can use the `sort` and `sortOrder` query parameters to sort the results of an API request. The `sort` parameter specifies the field to sort by, and the `sortOrder` parameter specifies the sort order (ascending or descending). For example, if you wanted to sort the results by the `name` field in ascending order, you would set `sort` to `name` and `sortOrder` to `asc`.

<Callout noIcon>The `sort` parameter supports any of the fields of the model being queried.</Callout>

<Callout noIcon>
  The `sortOrder` parameter supports `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending). This field is optional, and defaults to
  `desc` if not otherwise specified.
</Callout>

<TypeTable
  type={{
    sort: { type: "string", description: "The field to sort by." },
    sortOrder: { type: "string", default: "desc", description: "The sort order (asc or desc)." }
  }}
/>
