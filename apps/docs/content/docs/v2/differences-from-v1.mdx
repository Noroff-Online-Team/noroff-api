If you are migrating from v1, here are some of the major/breaking changes you should be aware of.

<Hr />

## New response format

The response format has changed.

### V1 vs V2

In v1, the response was a single object or an array of objects.

```json title="v1 - Old response format (Single resource)"
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "programming",
  "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
  "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
}
```

```json title="v1 - Old response format (Multiple resources)"
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
    "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?",
    "punchline": "None that's a hardware problem"
  }
]
```

In v2, the response is an object with a `data` property that contains the response object or array of objects, and a new `meta` property that contains pagination metadata for the resources.

If you're querying a single resource, the response `meta` property will be empty. If you're querying multiple resources, the response `meta` property will contain pagination metadata.

```json title="v2 - New response format (Single resource)"
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
    "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

```json title="v2 - New response format (Multiple resources)"
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "programming",
      "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
      "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "programming",
      "setup": "How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?",
      "punchline": "None that's a hardware problem"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "isFirstPage": true,
    "isLastPage": true,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "previousPage": null,
    "nextPage": null,
    "pageCount": 1,
    "totalCount": 2
  }
}
```

### Response type

<TypeTable
  type={{
    data: { type: "object | array", description: "The response data." },
    meta: { type: "object", default: "{}", description: "The response metadata." },
    "meta.isFirstPage": { type: "boolean", description: "Is this the first page of results?" },
    "meta.isLastPage": { type: "boolean", description: "Is this the last page of results?" },
    "meta.currentPage": { type: "number", description: "The current page number." },
    "meta.previousPage": { type: "number?", description: "The previous page number. Null if this is the first page." },
    "meta.nextPage": { type: "number?", description: "The next page number. Null if this is the last page." },
    "meta.pageCount": { type: "number", description: "The total number of pages." },
    "meta.totalCount": { type: "number", description: "The total number of results." }
  }}
/>

## New Media model

In v1, the `avatar`, `banner`, `image` and `media` properties were strings (or array of strings) that contained the URL of the image(s).

```json title="v1"
// Using "avatar" property as an example.
{
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
}
```

In v2, these properties all share the same new `Media` model. This is an object that contains the URL to the image, as well as an optional `alt` text. If there are multiple images, they are now stored in an array of `Media` objects.

```json title="v2 - New Media model"
// Using "avatar" property as an example.
{
  "avatar": {
    "url": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
    "alt": "Alt text"
  }
}
```

### Media type

Using `avatar` as an example. In v1, the `avatar` property was a string. In v2, it is an object. This means that the type of `avatar` has changed from `string` to `object`.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    avatar: { type: "object" },
    "avatar.url": { type: "string", description: "The URL to the image." },
    "avatar.alt": { type: "string", default: '""', description: "The alt text for the image." }
  }}
/>

## Requires API Key

In v1, you could use the autheniticated endpoints by providing a JWT access token in request headers.

```js title="v1 - Example of authorization"
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```

In v2, in addition to the JWT access token, you must also provide an API key. You can get an API key by using the [API Key](./auth/api-key) endpoint.

The API Key must be sent using `X-Noroff-API-Key` as header key.

```js title="v2 - Using access token and API key"
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    "X-Noroff-API-Key": apiKey
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```

## Unified Authentication

In v1, you were required to register and login a user for each of `Social`, `Auction House`, and `Holidaze`.

In v2, these have all been unified into a single authentication system. You can use the same [Register](./auth/register) and [Login](./auth/login) endpoints to register and login a user. No matter which endpoints you are using.

<Hr />

## Offset replaced by Page

> By default, the Noroff API sets the `limit` query parameter to 100. This is also the max. To get the next 100 results, you need to use pagination.

In v1, the `offset` query parameter was used to paginate results.

```js title="v1 - Example of pagination"
const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts?offset=100`)
const data = await response.json()
```

In v2, the `offset` query parameter has been replaced by the `page` query parameter. Instead of providing the number of results to skip, you now provide the page number.

```js title="v2 - Example of pagination"
const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts?page=2`)
const data = await response.json()
```

You can read more about pagination on the [Pagination & Sorting](./pagination-sorting) page.

## New API base URL structure

In v1, we followed a URL structure like this: `https://api.noroff.dev/api/<version>/<endpoint>`.

In v2, we have changed this to: `https://<version>.api.noroff.dev/<endpoint>`.

Not only does this make the URLs cleaner, but it also allows us to host the APIs separately. It'll make it easier for us to make changes to the APIs without breaking other versions.

You can read more about the new base URL on the [About](./about) page.

<Hr />

## Post reactions are toggled

In v1 it was impossible to remove a reaction from a post. If you reacted twice to a post with the same symbol, it would only add another reaction.

In v2, you can now toggle reactions. If the authenticated user has already reacted to the post with the provided symbol, the reaction will be removed. Otherwise, the reaction will be added.
