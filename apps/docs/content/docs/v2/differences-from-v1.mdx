If you are migrating from v1, here are some of the major/breaking changes you should be aware of.

<Hr />

## New response format

The response format has changed.

### V1 vs V2

In v1, the response was a single object or an array of objects.

```json title="v1 - Old response format (Single resource)"
{
  "id": 24,
  "type": "programming",
  "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
  "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
}
```

```json title="v1 - Old response format (Multiple resources)"
[
  {
    "id": 24,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
    "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
  },
  {
    "id": 25,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?",
    "punchline": "None that's a hardware problem"
  }
]
```

In v2, the response is an object with a `data` property that contains the response object or array of objects, and a new `meta` property that contains pagination metadata about the resources.

```json title="v2 - New response format (Single resource)"
{
  "data": {
    "id": 24,
    "type": "programming",
    "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
    "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

```json title="v2 - New response format (Multiple resources)"
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 24,
      "type": "programming",
      "setup": "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...",
      "punchline": "'Can I join you?'"
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "type": "programming",
      "setup": "How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?",
      "punchline": "None that's a hardware problem"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "isFirstPage": true,
    "isLastPage": true,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "previousPage": null,
    "nextPage": null,
    "pageCount": 1,
    "totalCount": 2
  }
}
```

### Response type

<TypeTable
  type={{
    data: { type: "object | array", description: "The response data." },
    meta: { type: "object", default: "{}", description: "The response metadata." },
    "meta.isFirstPage": { type: "boolean", description: "Is this the first page of results?" },
    "meta.isLastPage": { type: "boolean", description: "Is this the last page of results?" },
    "meta.currentPage": { type: "number", description: "The current page number." },
    "meta.previousPage": { type: "number?", description: "The previous page number. Null if this is the first page." },
    "meta.nextPage": { type: "number?", description: "The next page number. Null if this is the last page." },
    "meta.pageCount": { type: "number", description: "The total number of pages." },
    "meta.totalCount": { type: "number", description: "The total number of results." }
  }}
/>

## Images are now objects

In v1, the `avatar`, `banner`, `image` and `media` properties were strings (or array of strings) that contained the URL of the image.

```json title="v1"
// Using "avatar" property as an example.
{
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
}
```

In v2, these properties all share the same new `Media` model. This is an object that contains the URL to the image, as well as an optional `alt` text. If there are multiple images, they are now stored in an array of `Media` objects.

```json title="v2 - New Media model"
// Using "avatar" property as an example.
{
  "avatar": {
    "url": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
    "alt": "Alt text"
  }
}
```

### Media type

Using `avatar` as an example. In v1, the `avatar` property was a string. In v2, it is an object. This means that the type of `avatar` has changed from `string` to `object`.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    avatar: { type: "object?" },
    "avatar.url": { type: "string", description: "The URL to the image." },
    "avatar.alt": { type: "string?", default: '""', description: "The alt text for the image." }
  }}
/>

## Requires API Key

In v1, you could use the autheniticated endpoints by providing a JWT access token in request headers.

```js title="v1 - Example of authorization"
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```

In v2, in addition to the JWT access token, you must also provide an API key. You can get an API key by using the [API Key](./auth/api-key) endpoint.

The API Key must be sent using `X-Noroff-API-Key` as header key.

```js title="v2 - Using access token and API key"
const options = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    "X-Noroff-API-Key": apiKey
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts`, options)
const data = await response.json()
```

## Unified Authentication

In v1, you were required to register and login a user for each of `Social`, `Auction House`, and `Holidaze`.

In v2, these have all been unified into a single authentication system. You can use the same [Register](./auth/register) and [Login](./auth/login) endpoints to register and login a user. No matter which endpoints you are using.

<Hr />

## Offset replaced by Page

> By default, the Noroff API sets the `limit` query parameter to 100. This is also the max. To get the next 100 results, you need to use pagination.

In v1, the `offset` query parameter was used to paginate results.

```js title="v1 - Example of pagination"
const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts?offset=100`)
const data = await response.json()
```

In v2, the `offset` query parameter has been replaced by the `page` query parameter. Instead of providing the number of results to skip, you now provide the page number.

```js title="v2 - Example of pagination"
const response = await fetch(`${NOROFF_API_URL}/social/posts?page=2`)
const data = await response.json()
```

You can read more about pagination on the [Pagination & Sorting](./pagination-sorting) page.
